# HTML, CSS, Javascript Quickstart
This is a bare bones HTML, CSS, Javascript project. I have found it useful when I want to test very basic things before deploying them to a more complex codebase.

### File descriptions
In this repo, you will find the bare minimum:
  - index.html contains the html (duh)
  - js/index.js is a basic javascript file that prints to the Javascript console
  - css/index.css allows you to add CSS styling

Simply download the repo and open index.html in your browser to run this!

### Libraries: Bootstrap and JQuery

In index.html, I loaded:

- [Twitter Bootstrap] - allows you to design nice web pages more easily
- [jQuery] - makes Javascript coding easier
